<b> Overview </b> 
</p>
<p align=left>
Artificial intelligence involves the development of systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. 
These systems can now mimic routine, non-creative behaviors and automate certain processes. Knowledge of artificial intelligence,
which is called the technology of the future, gives a specialist a huge advantage. Artificial intelligence technology with a long 
enough history is still constantly growing and changing. There are great opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence â€“ 
after all, it can expand human possibilities in a way that is still difficult to imagine today.

## Program
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Details about the program can be found in the original CodeAcademy website under 
[here](https://codeacademy.lt/en/programavimo-kursai/artificial-intelligence-advance/).

## Jupyter in Browser
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You could run Jupyter through browser by doing so [here](https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/lab/index.html) and 
reading more about it in this [article](https://medium.com/geekculture/run-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-web-browser-using-jupyterlite-18e3bd25bd97).

If you find difficulty in running Jupyter Notebook through Browser then you could use Google Colab by clicking 
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). Functionalities of both machines are similar.
## Additional Material and Set Up
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Taught material that is not found in this repository can be inspected through [here](https://github.com/dqmis/code_academy_ai_course)
as that's additional course's repository from a colleague of this AI course. There you can also find installation notes.
